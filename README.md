# true_oop
Here, we can see how OOP automatically works without any extra implementation-related concepts like “class” or “prototype” or “inheritance”, etc. It is possible as long as the language is expressive enough (has a dynamic and structural/duck type system instead of a static and nominative one). There’s no class, there’s even no type (that is visible or matters to the user). All you have is objects that can dynamically change its own structure and behaviors, and interactions between objects. The object’s members and behaviors are directly attached to the object itself and irrelevant to the class or the type of the object. This form of OOP is far more expressive, flexible and even just much simpler than class-based OOP, especially class-based OOP in statically and nominatively typed languages like Java. You don’t need classes, you don’t need interfaces and inheritance to implement highly coupled so called “polymorphism” (subtyping), you don’t need design patterns, everything just “automatically works” thanks to duck typing. Also, I think it better fits the vision that Alan Kay had for OOP.
